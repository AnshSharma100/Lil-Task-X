Provide a competitor review for Habitica, Todoist, and Notion with differentiation gaps.\n3. Supply TAM/SAM/SOM ranges (use monetary ranges, no single point estimates).\n4. Deliver a SWOT analysis and acceptance boundaries (must-have, nice-to-have, out-of-scope).\n5. Include pricing and broader market insights to inform go-to-market planning.\n6. Reference the provided brief using 'data/product_description.txt:start-end'.\n7. Keep outputs concise enough to feed a PDF summary with charts.\n\nProduct brief:\nWe want to build a productivity tool that helps people plan and track their daily habits and goals.\\nCompetitors like Habitica, Todoist, and Notion are doing this but none of them feel simple enough.\\nWe want something fun, clean, and easy to use. The app should remind people to stay on track,\\nshow them their progress, and help them build good habits. It needs a mobile app and a small web dashboard.\\nWe want social features later, but not right now. The core is tracking habits and showing progress with simple charts.\\nThe look should feel calm and modern. We want the first version in 2-3 months.\"\n\nSchema reminder:\nReturn JSON shaped exactly as follows:\n{\n  \"product_spec\": {\n    \"title\": string,\n    \"summary\": string,\n    \"market_positioning\": string,\n    \"features\": [string],\n    \"personas\": [\n      {\"name\": string, \"needs\": string, \"pain_points\": string}\n    ],\n    \"competitor_matrix\": [\n      {\"competitor\": string, \"positioning\": string, \"differentiators\": [string], \"gaps\": [string]}\n    ],\n    \"swot\": {\n      \"strengths\": [string],\n      \"weaknesses\": [string],\n      \"opportunities\": [string],\n      \"threats\": [string]\n    },\n    \"acceptance_boundaries\": {\n      \"must_have\": [string],\n      \"nice_to_have\": [string],\n      \"out_of_scope\": [string]\n    },\n    \"market_category\": string,\n    \"pricing_insights\": [string],\n    \"tam_sam_som\": {\n      \"tam\": string, \"sam\": string, \"som\": string\n    },\n    \"kpis\": [string],\n    \"evidence_refs\": [string]\n  }\n}\n"
