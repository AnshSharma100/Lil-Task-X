We want to build a productivity tool that helps people plan and track their daily habits and goals.\nCompetitors like Habitica, Todoist, and Notion are doing this but none of them feel simple enough.\nWe want something fun, clean, and easy to use. The app should remind people to stay on track,\nshow them their progress, and help them build good habits. It needs a mobile app and a small web dashboard.\nWe want social features later, but not right now. The core is tracking habits and showing progress with simple charts.\nThe look should feel calm and modern. We want the first version in 2-3 months."
